Hi there! My name is Kenneth! I am 24 years old and I am from Monterey Park, California.

# Education 

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. Fight On!

# Profession
![alt text](image-2.png)

I currently do a handful of things -- computer science robotics research, math and ELA tutoring, teaching robotics.

I'm looking into getting a full-time position in engineering or in tech (IT, Systems, Software Development, etc).

# Hobbies

I enjoy working out, socializing, reading, and journaling. I used to restore vintage fountain pens, but now I'm just use them. My daily is a Sailor 1911 Pro (F) and I write daily on a Leuchtturm 1917 dotted A5 notebook.

# Reading List
Currently I am reading "So Good They Can't Ignore You" by Cal Newport, "Healing the Shame that Binds You" by John Bradshaw, and "The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter--And How To Make The Most of Them Now" by Meg Jay.

# What I Journal About
I usually journal about realizations in my life, things that bother me, mistakes I've made and how I can correct my behavior, or about things that help me process something I don't fully understand. Sometimes its just a dump of emotions and other times its a graph/table/chart of my best attempt to understand something.

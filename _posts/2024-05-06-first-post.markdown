First Post. Building a portfolio website. So far I've used Github Pages for deployment, GitHub for version control, Jekyll as the static site generator. Not sure if I need a backend or how to incorporate React.js into the project.

Next things:
* Include my tic tac toe project from React Tutorial
* Any other personal project?
* Add resume button on menu bar
* Add Projects button on menu Bar
  * Not sure if each project should just be a blog post or have its own separate page
* I should also look into the other themes and how to edit this blog (Minima?)
